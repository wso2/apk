                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.

                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".

                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing

                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note

                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must
                                          result in the implementation setting the

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the

                                          corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.
                                          \n - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding

                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".
                                          Implementers are encouraged to support extended
                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing

                                          implementations will be considered for inclusion
                                          in extended or core conformance levels.

                                          is specified using the ExtensionRef field.
                                          `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note

                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the

                                                  would not. \n ReplacePrefixMatch

                                          corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.

                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".

                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing

                                          is specified using the ExtensionRef field.
                                          `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note
                                          that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the

                                        meant as an extension point to express processing
                                        that may be done in Gateway implementations.

                                        implementing authentication strategies, rate-limiting,
                                        and traffic shaping. API guarantee/conformance
                                        is defined based on the type of the filter.

                                          corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.
                                          \n - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding
                                          configuration defined by \"Support: Extended\"
                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".
                                          Implementers are encouraged to support extended
                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing
                                          convergence in behavior across multiple
                                          implementations will be considered for inclusion
                                          in extended or core conformance levels.

                                          is specified using the ExtensionRef field.
                                          `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note
                                          that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the
                                                  prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd`
                                                  would not. \n ReplacePrefixMatch
