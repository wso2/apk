# Feature: Token revocation
#  Scenario: Testing token revocation
#    Given The system is ready
#    And I have a valid subscription
#    When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/jwt_basic_conf.yaml"
#    And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#    And make the API deployment request
#    Then the response status code should be 200
#    Then I set headers
#      |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#    And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/jwt-basic/3.14/employee/" with body ""
#    And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#      |429|
#      |401|
#    And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/jwt-basic/3.14/employee/" with body ""
#    And the response status code should be 200
#    # Revoke the token
#    Then I set headers

#    And I send "POST" request to "https://api.am.wso2.com:9095/api/notification/1.0.0/notify?type=TOKEN_REVOCATION" with body "{\"token\": \"${accessToken}\"}"
#    And the response status code should be 200
#    And I wait for 5 seconds
#    And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/jwt-basic/3.14/employee/" with body ""
#    And the response status code should be 401


#  Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#    Given The system is ready
#    And I have a valid subscription
#    When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#    Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#    Examples:
#      | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#      | jwt-basic-test          | 202                 |
