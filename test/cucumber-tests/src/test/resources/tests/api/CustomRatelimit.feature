# Feature: Custom ratelimit

#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers

#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                                | expectedStatusCode |
#       | custom-ratelimit-api                 | 202                |
