  Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
    Given The system is ready
    And I have a valid subscription
    When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
    Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

    Examples:
      | apiID                                    | expectedStatusCode |
      | af081022ed421049c5db87e8cbce67d3477d8415 | 202                |
      # | default-version-api-test                 | 202                |
      # | emp-api-test-scope                       | 202                |
      | version-api-test                         | 202                |
      | version-api-test2                        | 202                |
