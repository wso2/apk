# Feature: Semantic Versioning Based Intelligent Routing

#   Scenario: API version with Major and Minor version 1.0
#       Given The system is ready
#       And I have a valid subscription
#       When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/semantic-versioning/sem_api_v1-0.yaml"

#       Then the response status code should be 200
