# Feature: CORS Policy

#   Scenario: Testing CORS Policy
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/cors_API.apk-conf"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/cors_api.yaml"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And I wait for next minute
#     And I send "OPTIONS" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test_cors/2.0.0/anything/" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       | 429 |
#     And the response headers should not contain
#       | Access-Control-Allow-Origin      |
#       | Access-Control-Allow-Credentials |
#       | Access-Control-Allow-Methods     |
#       | Access-Control-Allow-Headers     |
#       | Access-Control-Max-Age           |
#     Then I set headers
#       | Origin | test.domain.com |
#     And I send "OPTIONS" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test_cors/2.0.0/anything/" with body ""

#       | Access-Control-Allow-Headers     |
#       | Access-Control-Max-Age           |
#     Then I set headers
#       | Origin | abc.com |
#     And I send "OPTIONS" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test_cors/2.0.0/anything/" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       | 429 |
#     And the response headers should contain
#       | Access-Control-Allow-Origin      | abc.com |
#       | Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | true    |
#     Then I set headers
#       | Origin                        | abc.com |
#       | Access-Control-Request-Method | GET     |

#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                                         | expectedStatusCode |
#       | cors-api-adff3dbc-2787-11ee-be56-0242ac120002 | 202                |
