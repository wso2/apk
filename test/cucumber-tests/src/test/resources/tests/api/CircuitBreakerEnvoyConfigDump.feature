# Feature: circuitBreakerMaxRequest
#   Scenario: Testing backend timeout
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/circuit-breaker-config-dump.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I wait for 5 seconds
#     And I send "GET" request to "http://default.gw.wso2.com:9000/config_dump" with body ""
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "\"max_connections\": 1111"
#     And the response body should contain "\"max_pending_requests\": 1112"
#     And the response body should contain "\"max_requests\": 1113"
#     And the response body should contain "\"max_retries\": 1114"
#     And the response body should contain "\"max_connection_pools\": 1115"

#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | circuit-breaker-config-dump          | 202                 |
