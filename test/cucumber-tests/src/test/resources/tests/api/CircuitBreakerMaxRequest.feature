# Feature: circuitBreakerMaxRequest
#   Scenario: Testing backend timeout
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/circuit-breaker-max-request-test.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/circuit-breaker-max-request/3.14/anything/test" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting

#     And I wait for 2 seconds
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/circuit-breaker-max-request/3.14/delay/10" with body ""
#     Then the response status code should be 503

#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | circuit-breaker-max-request-test          | 202                 |
