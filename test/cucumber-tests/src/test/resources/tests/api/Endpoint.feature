# Feature: Endpoint
#   Scenario: Testing API level and resource level endpoints
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/endpoint_conf.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/endpoint/3.14/employee" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/employee"
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.sandbox.gw.wso2.com:9095/endpoint/3.14/employee" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/test/employee"
#     And I send "POST" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/endpoint/3.14/employee" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/test/employee"
#     And I send "POST" request to "https://default.sandbox.gw.wso2.com:9095/endpoint/3.14/employee" with body ""

#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | endpoint-test          | 202                 |
