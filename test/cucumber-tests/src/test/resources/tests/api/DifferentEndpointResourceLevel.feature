# Feature: API different endpoint resource level
#   Scenario: Testing different endpoint resource level
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/different_endpoint_resource_level.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test-different-endpoint-resource-level/3.14/endpoint1" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/base1/endpoint1"
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test-different-endpoint-resource-level/endpoint2" with body ""
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/base2/endpoint2"


#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | different-endpoint-resource-level-test | 202 |
