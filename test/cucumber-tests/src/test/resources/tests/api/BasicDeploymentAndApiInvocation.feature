Feature: API Deployment and invocation
  Scenario: Deploying an API and basic http method invocations
    Given The system is ready

    When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/employees_conf.yaml"
    And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
    And make the API deployment request
    Then the response status code should be 200
    Then I set headers
      |Authorization|bearer ${accessToken}|
    And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test/3.14/employee/" with body ""

  Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
    Given The system is ready
    And I have a valid subscription
    When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
    Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

    Examples:
      | apiID                    | expectedStatusCode |
      | emp-api-test             | 202                |
      | default-version-api-test | 202                |
      | emp-api-test-scope       | 202                |
      | version-api-test         | 202                |
      | version-api-test2        | 202                |
