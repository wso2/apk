# Feature: AI Model Based Round Robin
#   Scenario: Testing API level API Policy with Model Based Round Robin and Multi Endpoints
#     Given The system is ready

#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API Level API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | chat-service-api-prod-sand          | 202                 |
