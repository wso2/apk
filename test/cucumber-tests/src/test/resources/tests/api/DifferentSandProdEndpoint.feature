# Feature: API different endpoint resource level
#   Scenario: Testing different endpoint resource level
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/different_sand_prod_endpoint.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test-different-sand-prod-endpoint/3.14/endpoint1" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/prodr/endpoint1"
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/test-different-sand-prod-endpoint/endpoint2" with body ""
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     And the response body should contain "https://backend/anything/prod/endpoint2"
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.sandbox.gw.wso2.com:9095/test-different-sand-prod-endpoint/3.14/endpoint1" with body ""
#     Then the response status code should be 200

#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.sandbox.gw.wso2.com:9095/test-different-sand-prod-endpoint/endpoint2" with body ""
