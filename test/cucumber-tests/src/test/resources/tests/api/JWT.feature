# Feature: Test JWT related functionalities
#   Scenario: Test JWT authentication with valid and invalid access token
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/jwt_basic_conf.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/jwt-basic/3.14/employee/" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting

#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#       |401|
#     Then I generate JWT token from idp1 with kid "456-789"
#     And I send "DELETE" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/jwt-basic/3.14/employee/1234" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#       |401|
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${idp-1-token}|

#     And I eventually receive 401 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#       |200|
#   Scenario: Test disabled JWT configuration
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/jwt_disabled_conf.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/employees_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer invalidToken|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/jwt-disabled/3.14/employee/" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#       |401|

#   Scenario: Test customized JWT headers
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/jwt_custom_header_conf.yaml"

#       |429|
#       |401|
#     And the response body should contain "\"X-Jwt-Assertion\""
#     And the "X-Jwt-Assertion" jwt should validate from JWKS "https://api.am.wso2.com:9095/.wellknown/jwks" and contain
#       | claim    | value    |
#       | claim1 | value1 |

#     Scenario: Test customized JWT headers with Resource Endpoint
#       Given The system is ready
#       And I have a valid subscription
#       When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/jwt_custom_header_resource_endpoint_conf.yaml"

#         |401|

#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | jwt-basic-test          | 202                 |
#       | jwt-disabled-test      | 202                 |
