# Feature: Basic auth
#   Scenario: Testing API level and resource level basic auth header
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I use the APK Conf file "artifacts/apk-confs/basic_auth_conf.yaml"
#     And the definition file "artifacts/definitions/basic_auth_api.json"
#     And make the API deployment request
#     Then the response status code should be 200
#     Then I set headers
#       |Authorization|Bearer ${accessToken}|
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/basic-auth/3.14/employee/" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "\"Authorization\": \"Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=\""
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/basic-auth/3.14/get" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "\"Authorization\": \"Basic ZHNmZHNmc2Rmc2RmOmFkbWlu\""
#     And I send "POST" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/basic-auth/3.14/post" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 200 response code, not accepting
#       |429|
#     And the response body should contain "\"Authorization\": \"Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=\""


#   Scenario Outline: Undeploy API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     When I undeploy the API whose ID is "<apiID>"
#     Then the response status code should be <expectedStatusCode>

#     Examples:
#       | apiID                 | expectedStatusCode  |
#       | basic-auth-api-test          | 202                 |

#   Scenario: Testing undeployed API
#     Given The system is ready
#     And I have a valid subscription
#     Then I set headers
#       | Authorization | Bearer ${accessToken} |
#     And I send "GET" request to "https://default.gw.wso2.com:9095/basic-auth/3.14/employee/" with body ""
#     And I eventually receive 404 response code, not accepting
#       | 200 |
