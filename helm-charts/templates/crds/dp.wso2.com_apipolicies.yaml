                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.

                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".

                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing

                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note

                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must
                                          result in the implementation setting the

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the

                                          corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.
                                          \n - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding

                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".
                                          Implementers are encouraged to support extended
                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing

                                          implementations will be considered for inclusion
                                          in extended or core conformance levels.

                                          is specified using the ExtensionRef field.
                                          `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note

                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the

                                                  would not. \n ReplacePrefixMatch

                                          corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.

                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".

                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing

                                          is specified using the ExtensionRef field.
                                          `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note
                                          that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the

                                        meant as an extension point to express processing
                                        that may be done in Gateway implementations.

                                        implementing authentication strategies, rate-limiting,
                                        and traffic shaping. API guarantee/conformance
                                        is defined based on the type of the filter.

                                          corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                                          Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                                          All implementations must support core filters.
                                          \n - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding
                                          configuration defined by \"Support: Extended\"
                                          in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\".
                                          Implementers are encouraged to support extended
                                          filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                                          that are defined and supported by specific
                                          vendors. In the future, filters showing
                                          convergence in behavior across multiple
                                          implementations will be considered for inclusion
                                          in extended or core conformance levels.

                                          is specified using the ExtensionRef field.
                                          `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                          for custom filters. \n Implementers are
                                          encouraged to define custom implementation
                                          types to extend the core API with implementation-specific
                                          behavior. \n If a reference to a custom
                                          filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                          MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that
                                          would have been processed by that filter
                                          MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n Note
                                          that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                          must ensure that unknown values will not
                                          cause a crash. \n Unknown values here must

                                                  elements. A path element refers

                                                  specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                                  For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                                  and `/abc/def` would all match the
                                                  prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd`
                                                  would not. \n ReplacePrefixMatch

                                  ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that

                                  When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                                  honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.
                                  Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                                  Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.
                                  If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                                  backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                                  protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.
                                  If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                                  protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                                  "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                                    match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                    to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch

                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                                header in the response.
                                                If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the
                                                following rules:
                                                * If redirect scheme is not-empty, the redirect port MUST be the well-known
                                                  port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                                  and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                                  well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                                * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                                  Listener port.
                                                Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                                header in the following cases:
                                                * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                                  the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.

                                            Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                            types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                            - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                              implementations must support core filters.
                                            - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                              are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                            - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                              specific vendors.
                                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                              implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                              conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                              is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                              "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                            Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                            extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                            If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                            MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                            that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.
                                            Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                            must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.
                                            Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                            Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                            Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                                    match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                    to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                    of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                  Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                                  Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.
                                  If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                                  backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                                  protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.
                                  If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                                  protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the

                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                                  and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a

                                            Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                            types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                            - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                              implementations must support core filters.
                                            - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                              are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                            - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                              specific vendors.
                                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                              implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                              conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                              is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                              "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                            Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                            extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                            If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                            MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                            that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.
                                            Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                            must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.
                                            Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                            Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                            Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                                          enum:

                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                  honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.
                                  Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                                  Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.
                                  If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                                  backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                                  protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.
                                  If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                                  protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                                  "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                                    match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                    to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                    of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                                  and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a

                                            Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                            types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                            - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                              implementations must support core filters.
                                            - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                              are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                            - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                              specific vendors.
                                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                              implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                              conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                              is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                              "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                            Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                            extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                            If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                            MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                            that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.
                                            Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations

                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                                    match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                    to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                    of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      weights does not need to equal 100.
                                      If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                                      of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                                      traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
                                      defaults to 1.
                                      Support for this field varies based on the context where used.

                                  When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                                  honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.
                                  Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                                  Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.
                                  If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                                  backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                                  protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.
                                  If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                                  protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                                  "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                                    match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                    to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch

                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                            Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                            types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                            - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                              implementations must support core filters.
                                            - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                              "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                              are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                            - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                              specific vendors.
                                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                              implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                              conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                              is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                              "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                            Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                            extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                            If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                            MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                            that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.
                                            Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                            must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.
                                            Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                            Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                            Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                                    match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                                    to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                                    of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                                    Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                                    matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                                    in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                                    ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                                    match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                                    ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                                    Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                                    the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      Kind is the Kubernetes resource kind of the referent. For example

                                      ExternalName services can refer to CNAME DNS records that may live
                                      outside of the cluster and as such are difficult to reason about in
                                      terms of conformance. They also may not be safe to forward to (see
                                      CVE-2021-25740 for more information). Implementations SHOULD NOT
                                      support ExternalName Services.

                                      Weight specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the referenced
                                      backend. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this
                                      BackendRefs list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from
                                      the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                                      implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                                      weights does not need to equal 100.
                                      If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                                      of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                                      traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
                                      defaults to 1.
                                      Support for this field varies based on the context where used.

                    be used as part of Policy resources that need to be able to target resources
                    in different namespaces. For more information on how this policy attachment
                    model works, and a sample Policy resource, refer to the policy attachment
