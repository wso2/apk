Welcome to the WSO2 Kubernetes Gateway!

Congratulations. You've successfully deployed WSO2 Kubernetes using Helm, you'll need to monitor and manage the deployment to ensure everything is running smoothly.

   - Monitor Pods:
     Check the status of the pods to ensure they are up and running:
     ---
     kubectl get pods
     ---

   - Monitor Services:
     Verify that the services are running and find their external IPs to access the APIs:
     ---
     kubectl get services
     ---

For more detailed information, troubleshooting, and advanced configurations, we encourage you to explore the official WSO2 documentation.
