                    HTTPBackendRef defines how a HTTPRoute forwards a HTTP request.

                    Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified, a
                    ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
                    namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
                    documentation for details.

                    <gateway:experimental:description>

                    When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                    honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.

                    Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                    Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.

                    If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                    backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                    protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.

                    If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                    protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                    "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                              This filter can be used multiple times within the same rule. Note that
                              not all implementations will be able to support mirroring to multiple

                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in

                                    port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                    and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                    well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                  * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                    Listener port.

                                  Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                  header in the following cases:

                                  * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                    the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                  * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                    the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                              Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                              types are classified into three conformance levels:

                              - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                implementations must support core filters.

                              - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                are encouraged to support extended filters.

                              - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                specific vendors.
                                In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

                              Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                              extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                              If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                              that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                              Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                              must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                              Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                              Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                              Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                  replacePrefixMatch:
                                    description: |-
                                      ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                      match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                      to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                      of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".

                                      Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                      matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                      ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                      match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                      the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

              parentRefs:
                description: |-
                  ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                  to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                  allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                  the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                  namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                  namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                  and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                  create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                  Route.

                  There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                  resources.

                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                  Some examples:

                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                    same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                    object must also set `port`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                  merged.

                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

                  <gateway:experimental:description>
                  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                  routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                  any namespace to the Service.

                  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                  "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                  connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                  the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                  ParentRef of the Route.

                        differently based on the type of parent resource.

                        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                        must match both specified values.

                        <gateway:experimental:description>
                        When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                        Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                        the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                        Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                        Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                        document how/if Port is interpreted.

                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                      description: |-
                        SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                        following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                        * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                        both specified values.
                        * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                        both specified values.

                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                        interpreted.

                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
